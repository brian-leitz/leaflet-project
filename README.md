# leaflet-project
Using JavaScript, VS Code, and Leaflet to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The script files for this project are located in the static folder, with there being one css script and one js script to build the content within the map.
